This is a standalone iOS app for tracking USCIS case status automatically.

You can input as many as cases you have to track, the app will check the status in the background and send push notifications if there is update in status.

Since it's a standalone app and there is no remote server involved, you have to open the app once every week to make sure iOS will schedule the checking in background

This is for iOS 13+
